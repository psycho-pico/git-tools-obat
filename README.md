### Examples

`Auto` patch installed `The App` (maybe require `sudo` privileges on `GNU/Linux`) By Default Patch `Pro`

```bash
$ yarn gitcracken patcher
```
`The App On-Premise Serverless Client` patch

```bash
$ yarn gitcracken patcher -f serverless
```

Use custom path to `app.asar`

```bash
$ yarn gitcracken patcher --asar ~/Downloads/gitkraken/resources/app.asar
```

Use custom `actions` (`backup`, `unpack` and `patch`)

```bash
$ yarn gitcracken patcher backup unpack patch
```

## Notice

### It need to refresh the The App account information after this patch

This patch will modify your license while The App fetching your profile. So if you still got free edition, you should re-login your The App account.

Please ensure the communication with The App server. Somebody may blocked the The App server by the DNS or hosts file, please comment out or remove it temporarily.

If you still got free edition after re-login. Deleting the local profile might help. (Usually the path is `%appdata%\.gitkraken` for Windows, or `~/.gitkraken` for Linux or macOS)

### On macOS you should patch The App after first launch.

There is a quarantine flag while downloading an App from Internet. If you changed it before the first launch, macOS will think the App was broken.

If you already do that, you can execute `sudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine /Application/The App.app` to remove quarantine flag.

Search `macos quarantine` for more details.

### This patch only works with The App 7.7.0 and later
